# collaborators-tracking-platform

It was created to enable data exchange of collaborators in agricultural trade. Includes information on daily needs and crops to be collected daily.

In the coming days, I will add an addition that can create routes where crops can be collected at once.

Open Terminal on your computer and apply the example;
